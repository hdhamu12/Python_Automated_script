To get the list of dependencies of any python code.

1.  Make sure you have the command line client installed (eg. Anaconda)
2.  First need to install the command pipreqs on the machine
                pip install pipreqs
    Note: this command will install the pipreqs command on the system.
3.  Now, using the pipreqs command, we will find the dependencies of the given python code in a file named requirements.txt
                pipreqs "D:\Project\ETL Monitoring\Updated_20200520\prescriptive_marketing-Data-Monitoring (1)\prescriptive_marketing-Data-Monitoring\Data_Monitoring"
    Note: the successful execution of above command will create a requirements.txt file in the same working directory.
